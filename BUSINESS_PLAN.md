## 📋 Executive Summary

### **Product Overview**
Analytics Engine is a real-time, streaming-first analytics platform that provides on-demand KPI calculations with configurable refresh periods. The platform enables enterprises to monitor business performance across multiple value chains (Supply Chain, CRM, Sales, Financial) with real-time dashboards and comprehensive analytics capabilities.

### **Market Opportunity**
- **Target Market**: Mid to large enterprises ($50M+ annual revenue)
- **Industries**: Manufacturing, Retail, Healthcare, Financial Services
- **Problem**: Fragmented analytics, lack of real-time visibility, high costs of custom solutions
- **Solution**: Unified, real-time analytics platform with pre-built KPIs

### **Business Model**
- Annual licensing fees (value chain-based)
- Implementation services (one-time)
- Managed services (recurring)
- Infrastructure hosting (recurring)

### **Financial Projections (3-Year Summary) - Lean Startup Model**
- **Year 1**: 5 clients, $701K revenue, $641K profit (91% margin)
- **Year 2**: 15 total clients, $1.7M revenue, $1.4M profit (81% margin)
- **Year 3**: 30 total clients, $3.2M revenue, $2.6M profit (81% margin)
- **3-Year Cumulative**: $5.5M revenue, $4.6M profit (82% margin)

**Note**: Lean model with 2 founders, outsourced development, remote work, minimal overhead. Highly profitable from Year 1 due to $100K average implementation fees! Development is local (Git), only staging environment needed. Includes industry standard licensing costs (ASCM SCOR, etc.) at $12K/year. Client infrastructure costs (~$749K over 3 years) are NOT included in our revenue - clients pay their cloud providers directly.

- Emergency fund: $59K

**Funding Sources**:

**Use of Funds**:
- Marketing & sales acceleration: $200K (40%)
