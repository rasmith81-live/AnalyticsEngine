ASCM SCOR Framework Module

The Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) model is a process reference model 
developed by ASCM (Association for Supply Chain Management) that provides a 
standardized framework for supply chain processes, metrics, practices, and skills.

Version: SCOR Digital Standard v14.0
Source: ASCM (Association for Supply Chain Management)
URL: https://www.ascm.org/corporate-transformation/standards-and-frameworks/scor/

The SCOR model provides:
- Hierarchical process structure (Levels 0-4)
- Performance metrics (Strategic L1, Diagnostic L2, Operational L3)
- Performance attributes (Reliability, Responsiveness, Agility, Costs, Profit, Assets, Environmental, Social)
- Best practices categorized by type and pillar
- Skills and competencies with proficiency levels
- Industry benchmarks for comparison

This module serves as the foundation for SCOR framework integration, enabling:
- Standardized supply chain process definitions
- Industry-recognized performance metrics
- Benchmarking against SCOR standards
- Gap analysis and compliance tracking
- Skills and competency mapping
