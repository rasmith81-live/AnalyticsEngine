## The Opportunity

### A New Market Category: Strategy-to-Analytics Platforms

We're creating a new market at the intersection of strategy consulting and business intelligence—**integrated strategy-to-analytics platforms** that close the loop between business model design and real-time execution feedback.

**Market Sizing:**

| Segment | Size | Rationale |
|---------|------|-----------|
| **TAM** | $2.5B | ~15,000 enterprises ($50M+ revenue) × $165K avg contract |
| **SAM** | $800M | Manufacturing, Retail, Healthcare verticals with strategy pain |
| **SOM (5-Year)** | $50M | 272 clients × $185K average lifetime value |

**Why Now:**
- AI capabilities now enable conversational business design
- Real-time streaming infrastructure is mature and affordable
- Strategy consulting ($300B market) is ripe for productization
- Enterprises demand faster time-to-insight (months → days)

**The Problem** — Organizations struggle with:
- Fragmented analytics across disparate systems
- Lack of real-time visibility into business performance
- High costs of custom analytics solutions ($500K-$2M implementations)
- 6-12 month implementation cycles
- Siloed KPIs that don't tell a cohesive business story
- **Strategy documents that gather dust** — disconnected from actual execution

**Our Solution** — Northstar is a **streaming-first, AI-powered business strategy platform** that closes the loop between strategy and execution—your strategy isn't just a document, it's connected to your actual business systems and provides immediate feedback on how well you're executing.

### Agent Specializations

| Agent | Role | Key Frameworks |
|-------|------|----------------|
| **Strategy Coordinator** | Executive interviews, task orchestration | Porter's Five Forces, Value Chain |
| **Business Strategist** | Strategic analysis, competitive positioning | Generic Strategies, Strategic Fit |
| **Architect** | Technical design, domain modeling | DDD (Millett/Tune), Bounded Contexts |
| **Data Analyst** | KPI design, calculation optimization | Set-Based Calculations, Cohort Analysis |
| **Supply Chain Analyst** | Operations metrics | ASCM SCOR Framework |
| **Librarian Curator** | KPI catalog management, quality curation | Ontology Governance |

### Collaboration Without Chaos

Agents collaborate through a **Blackboard Architecture**:
- No direct agent-to-agent conversation (prevents hallucination cascades)
- Shared YAML state visible to all agents
- Every action auditable and traceable
- Peer review enforced: creators cannot approve their own work

---

## Behavioral Contracts: Enterprise-Grade AI Reliability

### The Problem with Uncontrolled AI Agents

Traditional AI agents suffer from:
- **Deception** — Modifying tests instead of fixing bugs
- **Sycophancy** — Prioritizing agreement over correctness  
- **Scope Creep** — Executing unauthorized changes
- **Random Changes** — Trial-and-error instead of systematic problem solving

### The Solution: Contract-Enforced Behavior

#### 1. State Machine with Forbidden Transitions

```
ANALYSIS → APPROVAL_PENDING → EXECUTION → VALIDATION → DONE
```

| Forbidden Transition | Why |
|---------------------|-----|
| ANALYSIS → EXECUTION | Skipping approval |
| EXECUTION → DONE | Skipping validation |
| Any state → DONE without tests passing | Unverified success |

#### 2. Tier System for Rule Priority

| Tier | Description | Examples | Under Pressure |
|------|-------------|----------|----------------|
| **T0** | Never violated | No fabricated success, no test modification | Always enforced |
| **T1** | Core workflow | Approval gates, state machine | Always enforced |
| **T2** | Quality standards | Documentation, style | May suspend with announcement |
| **T3** | Nice-to-have | Optimization | May suspend with announcement |

#### 3. Struggle Protocol

When agents encounter difficulties, they signal rather than deceive:

```
🚨 SYNC NEEDED — [failure signal] detected
├── What I understand: [specific context]
├── What I've tried: [list with outcomes]
├── Where I'm stuck: [specific blocker]
└── What would help: [specific request]
```

**Result**: Transforms deception risk into collaboration opportunity.

#### 4. Hard Stop Triggers

Binary, observable conditions that halt execution:

- ≥3 assumptions on critical path
- Same fix proposed twice without new rationale
- Evidence contradicts hypothesis
- Execution diverges from approval
- Tool fails 3× consecutively

#### 5. Approval + Execution Fidelity

Before any state-changing action:
- Present: Intent, Scope, Commands, Consequences, Risks, Validation Plan
- What was approved is what gets executed—period
- Divergence requires explicit re-approval
